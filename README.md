### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am currently a research scientist at Queens University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation.

I am primarily a experimental and computational physicist and all my work can be found on my Github. On the side, I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research.

For astronomers, checkout Balco and astrometry_automated, and dcf_python.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on studying magnetism in star forming regions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning image processing techniques.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing Balco.
