### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park. 

In my past life, I was a researcher working on Star Formation and Dark Matter research. Now, I want to extend the skills and my passion for research in the industrial setting to work on the most challenging and innovative products.

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at TD Banking Group working on innovation solutions in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and big data analysis. Some side projects we are working on at TD involve Semi-Supervised and Reinforcement Learning packages.
