### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am currently a research scientist at Queens University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation.

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 
I have am currently developing (or have developed):
<ol>  
    <li> OACpy- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.</li>
    <li> DCF_Python- The modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method used to calculate the magnetic field strength in the ISM via polarization of lights. </li>
    <li> Astrometry Automated- A simple Python script which automatically records any solution found in a directory of images. </li>
</ol>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning image processing techniques.
<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing OACpy (and my other projects).
