### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am currently a research scientist at Queens University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation.

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 
I am currently developing (or have developed):
<ol>  
    <ul> MagnaPY- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.</ul>
    <ul> MDCF - The modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method based off the paper written by Houde et al. 2009.</ul>
</ol>

### Interests :atom:
ðŸ”­ My focus is on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<ol>
    <br>
    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning image processing techniques.
    <br>
     <br>
    ðŸŒ± I am also making the slow (but certain) transition towards Machine Learning.
