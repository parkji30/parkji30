### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am currently a Graduate Student at Queens University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation.

I am primarily a experimental and computational physicist and all my work can be found on my Github. On the side, I enjoy developing open source software that can aid other scientists in their research.

For astronomers, checkout Balco and astrometry_automated.

**parkji30/parkji30** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning image processing techniques.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing Balco.
