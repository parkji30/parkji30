### Hi There 👋
My name is James Park and I am a Physicist at Queen's University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation. 

Outside of academia, I work as a Machine Learning Scientist for RBC (The Royal Bank of Canada)

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 

I am currently developing (or have developed):
<ol>  
    :computer: MagnaPY- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.
    <br>
    :computer: MDCF - The Modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi Method which calcualtes a magnetic field strength based off polarization data.
</ol>

### Interests :atom:
🔭 My focus is on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<ol>
    🌱 I am fascinated by Dark Matter and am planning to work on the GigaBIT Project, a mission aimed to understanding the mass-energy content of Dark Matter.
    <br>
    🌱 I am also fascinated with applications of Machine Learning and how they will change the landscape of quantiative research fields.
