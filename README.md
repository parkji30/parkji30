### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am a Physicist at Queen's University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation. 

Outside of academia, I work as a Machine Learning Data Scientist for RBC (The Royal Back of Canada)

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 

I am currently developing (or have developed):
<ol>  
    <ul> MagnaPY- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.</ul>
    <ul> MDCF - The Modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi Method which calcualtes a magnetic field strength based off polarization data.</ul>
</ol>

### Interests :atom:
ðŸ”­ My focus is on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<ol>
    <br>
    ðŸŒ± I am fascinated by Dark Matter and am planning to work on the GIGABit Project, a mission aimed to understanding the mass-energy content of Dark Matter.
    <br>
    ðŸŒ± I am also fascinated with applications of Machine Learning and how they will change the landscape of quantiative research fields.
