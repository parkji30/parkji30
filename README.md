### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am a Physicist at Queen's University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation. 

Outside of academia, I work as a Machine Learning Scientist for RBC (The Royal Bank of Canada)

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 

I am currently developing :computer: (or have developed) :
<ol>  
     MagnaPY -- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.
    <br>
     MDCF -- The Modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi Method which calcualtes a magnetic field strength based off polarization data.
    <br> 
     ICS -- An Image Compression Simulator that analyzes the pre and post compression effect on simulated images generated through Monte Carlo methods.
</ol>

### Interests :atom:
ðŸ”­ My focus is on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<ol> 
    ðŸŒ±
    Dark Matter, lol what is this.
    <br>
    Machine Learning, a.k.a glorified curve fitting.
    <br>
