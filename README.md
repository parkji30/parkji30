### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park. 

In my past life, I was a Physicist working on the advancing the theory
of Star Formation. I've always wanted to pursue a Ph.D., to work on the coolest
and most ground breaking problems in industry. However, my colleagues have shown
me that this is not necessary and thus, I have decided to exit academia with
just a Masters degree.

Currently, I am a Machine Learning Innovation Scientist at TD Banking Group working
on innovation solutions in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain and i
Reinforcment Learning models.

My other projects involve big data analysis using PySpark. I am grateful for being 
given this opportunity and would like to pay my dues forward for anyone seeking
advice.
