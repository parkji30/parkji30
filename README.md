### Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Park and I am currently a research scientist at Queens University studying the role of magnetic fields in star formation.

I enjoy developing open source software to aid other scientists in their research. 
I am currently developing (or have developed):
<ol>  
    <ul> OACpy- a compression optimization software that can be used in any data pipeline.</ul>
    <ul> Modified-DCF_Python- The modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method based off the paper written by Houde et al. 2009.</ul>
    <ul> Astrometry Automated- A simple Python script which automatically records any solution found in a directory of images. </ul>
</ol>

### Interests :atom:
ðŸ”­ My focus is on studying magnetism in star forming regions.
<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning image processing techniques.
<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on developing OACpy (and my other projects).
